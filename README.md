# GridWorld_RL
The first Reinforcement Learning grid world coursework completed. This involved writing Monte-carlo and temporal difference learning algorithms. On top of this, optimisation dynamic programming algorithms were written to determine the optimal value function.

An example of an optimal policy generated:

The optimal value function generated through value iteration:
